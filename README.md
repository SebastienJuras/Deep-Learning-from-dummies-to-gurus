# Deep-Learning-from-dummies-to-gurus
understand the parameters involved in a deep learning algorythm.

In order to understand how deep learning is working and more specially convolutional neural network, I propose to start with a very easy problem and try to make varying the different parameters to analyze their impacts.

In order to share the progress of knwoledge around convolutional neural network, I will maintain a list of questions I face during the different analysis I launched and try to answer to these questions. Each of the answers should be explained by code examples so that everybody can reproduce the experiment that lead to this conclusion.

I use python 2

Of course, this is an open project, any explanations for some questions are welcome.
